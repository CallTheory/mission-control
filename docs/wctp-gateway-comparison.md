# WCTP Gateway Feature Comparison

This document compares the WCTP implementation in Mission Control with the `calltheory/wctp-gateway` project.

## ✅ Features Already Implemented in Mission Control

### Core WCTP Support
- **WCTP Endpoint**: `/wctp` (matching wctp-gateway)
- **WCTP v1.3 Protocol Support**: Full support via custom implementation and `notifius/php-wctp` library
- **XML Parsing & Validation**: Complete implementation for parsing incoming WCTP messages
- **Response Generation**: Creates WCTP-compliant success/failure responses

### Message Handling
- **SubmitRequest**: ✅ Fully supported
- **ClientQuery**: ✅ Supported for status checking
- **MessageReply**: ✅ Basic support implemented
- **Message forwarding via Twilio**: ✅ Complete with status callbacks

### Security & Authentication
- **Encrypted credential storage**: ✅ Using Laravel's encryption for sensitive data in DataSource
- **Feature flag system**: ✅ For enabling/disabling WCTP gateway

### Management UI
- **WCTP Gateway configuration page**: ✅ Available at `/utilities/wctp-gateway`
- **Test message panel**: ✅ For sending test WCTP messages
- **Twilio configuration in DataSource**: ✅ System Settings → Data Sources → Twilio

## ❌ Features NOT Yet Implemented (from wctp-gateway)

### 1. **Enterprise Host Management**
- wctp-gateway has a full Enterprise Host CRUD system with:
  - Multiple hosts with unique senderID/securityCode pairs
  - Enable/disable individual hosts
  - Host-specific URL configuration for callbacks
  - Host assignment to phone numbers

**Current Mission Control**: Uses feature flags and team-based access, but not individual Enterprise Host records

### 2. **Multiple Carrier Support with Priority/Failover**
- wctp-gateway supports multiple carriers:
  - Twilio, ThinQ, Sunwire, Bandwidth, Generic Webhook
  - Priority-based carrier selection
  - Automatic failover between carriers
  - Carrier verification system

**Current Mission Control**: Only Twilio support via DataSource

### 3. **Phone Number Management**
- wctp-gateway has comprehensive number management:
  - Available number lookup from carriers
  - Number provisioning/setup
  - Number assignment to specific Enterprise Hosts
  - Enable/disable individual numbers

**Current Mission Control**: Uses single Twilio from_number in DataSource

### 4. **Message Queue & Status Tracking**
- wctp-gateway uses Laravel Jobs for:
  - Queued message processing (ProcessOutboundMessage)
  - Status synchronization (SyncOutboundStatus)
  - Detailed message lifecycle tracking
  - Retry logic with failure handling

**Current Mission Control**: Direct sending, basic status caching

### 5. **Transient Client Support**
- wctp-gateway supports both:
  - SubmitRequest (Enterprise Host)
  - SubmitClientMessage (Transient Client)

**Current Mission Control**: Only SubmitRequest

### 6. **Reply System**
- wctp-gateway has "Reply with X" parsing:
  - Automatic detection of reply phrases
  - Reply number extraction and routing

**Current Mission Control**: Basic MessageReply support but no reply routing

### 7. **Additional WCTP Operations**
- wctp-gateway appears to support more operations
- TransparentData payloads (base64 encoded)

**Current Mission Control**: Basic TransparentData parsing exists

### 8. **Driver Architecture**
- wctp-gateway uses a pluggable driver system:
  - Abstract SMSDriver class
  - Driver factory pattern
  - Easy to add new carriers

**Current Mission Control**: Direct Twilio integration

### 9. **Event Logging**
- wctp-gateway has comprehensive event logging:
  - LogEvent job for all WCTP interactions
  - Failed connection logging
  - Event viewer in UI

**Current Mission Control**: Basic Laravel logging

### 10. **Security Features**
- wctp-gateway additional security:
  - MFA/2FA support for user accounts
  - Login notifications
  - Email verification required

## 🔧 Recommendations for Feature Parity

### High Priority
1. **Implement Enterprise Host Management**
   - Create `enterprise_hosts` table
   - Add CRUD operations for hosts
   - Support multiple senderID/securityCode pairs

2. **Add Message Queue System**
   - Create `messages` table for tracking
   - Implement job-based message processing
   - Add retry logic and failure handling

3. **Support Multiple Carriers**
   - Abstract carrier interface
   - Add support for at least one backup carrier
   - Implement priority/failover logic

### Medium Priority
4. **Phone Number Management**
   - Create number management interface
   - Support multiple from numbers
   - Number-to-host assignment

5. **Enhanced Status Tracking**
   - Persistent message status storage
   - Status synchronization jobs
   - Message history viewing

6. **Reply System**
   - Parse "Reply with X" patterns
   - Route replies appropriately

### Low Priority
7. **Additional Carriers**
   - ThinQ/Commio
   - Bandwidth
   - Generic webhook

8. **Transient Client Support**
   - SubmitClientMessage operation
   - Different validation rules

9. **Event System**
   - Comprehensive event logging
   - Event viewer UI

## Summary

Mission Control has a solid WCTP foundation with:
- ✅ Core WCTP protocol support
- ✅ Twilio integration
- ✅ Basic management UI
- ✅ Your `notifius/php-wctp` library integration

To match wctp-gateway's feature set, the main additions needed are:
1. Enterprise Host management system
2. Message queuing and lifecycle tracking
3. Multiple carrier support with failover
4. Phone number management
5. Enhanced status tracking and reporting

The current implementation is functional for basic WCTP-to-SMS forwarding but lacks the robustness and flexibility of the full wctp-gateway system, particularly around multi-tenancy (Enterprise Hosts), carrier failover, and message lifecycle management.
