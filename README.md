# Mission Control

[Mission Control](https://calltheory.com/mission-control) is a web-based utility dashboard for [Amtelco](https://callcenter.amtelco.com) call center environments created by [Call Theory](https://calltheory.com).


## No Amtelco Affiliation

Mission Control is an unofficial community project and is not endorsed, sponsored, or otherwise affiliated with [Amtelco](https://www.amtelco.com). All Amtelco trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Amtelco brand are the sole property of Amtelco or its licensors.

## Requirements

Based on the [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com), you'll need:

- PHP 8.3+
- Composer 2+
- Node.js 18+
- A [compatible database](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/database)

You'll also need the following system libraries:

- `sox`
- `lame`
- `sox-mp3-format`

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install sox lame libsox-fmt-mp3
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/calltheory/mission-control.git

# Move into the repository
cd mission-control

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install JavaScript dependencies
npm install

# Build assets
npm run build

# Copy the environment file
cp .env.example .env

# You should probably modify the .env file 
# for your environment at this point

# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Setup public storage link
php artisan storage:link
```

## Development

In local environments, you can use [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/sail)

```bash
# Start docker container using sail
vendor/bin/sail up -d

# Instead of `php artisan migrate`
vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
```

> You can (and should) also [create a shell alias for sail](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/sail#configuring-a-shell-alias)

For any normal artisan command that interacts with a cache or database, you'll want to use `sail` in place of `php` so the command runs in the testing environment. 

```bash
sail artisan storage:link
sail artisan migrate
sail artisan horizon
# etc...
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Sail/docker environments
vendor/bin/sail artisan test

# Non-sail/docker environments
# php artisan test
```
